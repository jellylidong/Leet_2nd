/*Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums
that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of
the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Return 3.
The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2]
and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.*/

/*My analysis
* define s(i) is the sum of [0 ... i]
* so s(j)-s(i) is the sum of[i+1, j]
* so note: s(i)-s(0) is the sum of [1...i]
* we can get sum of [0 ... i] by s(i)-s(j)
* to solve this, we need to have an array sums with length n+1
* where sums[i] is the sum of nums[0..i-1], and sums[0] is 0
*
* let's see how merge sort works
* first we have b and a, we can get merge-sorted result [a,b]
* then we have [a1,a2] and [b1,b2], both array are sorted
* we can get how many number in B that are
* lower <= bi-ai <= upper
* then we sort this two parts and continue the further counting
*
* similarly, in this problem, first we can get sums[0 ... n]
* where sum[i] is the sum of [0 .. i-1]
* we can find the range sum by divide and conquer using merge sort
* for each sub-array [s,e),
* the mid is m = (s+e)/2
* since this sub-array has already been sorted by previous operations,
* so sums of [s to m) is always <= sums of[m, e)
* so we can find the number of the target range sum of the former part from the latter part
* and then sort the whole sub-array
